# Sudoku Solver using Deep Learning and Backtracking Algorithm

This project is a Sudoku solver that utilizes a combination of Deep learning and a backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. The solver is capable of scanning Sudoku puzzles from images, applying a deep learning model to recognize and understand the puzzle layout, and then using a backtracking algorithm to find the solution and a feature of automatically filling the grid for you in the website , all you have to do is just click.

## Features

- **Sudoku Recognition**: The solver can scan Sudoku puzzles from images using image processing techniques.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a deep learning model to recognize and understand the puzzle layout.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Applies a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to the Sudoku puzzle.
- **Web Interface**: Automatically fills the solved Sudoku puzzle on a website.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- TensorFlow (for machine learning model)

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! Here are some areas where you can contribute:
